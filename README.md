## Description:

This is a fun and engaging single-player game where you test your ability to match emotions displayed on an image with corresponding text buttons.

## Features:

**Emotion Matching:** Challenge yourself to correctly identify emotions from a variety of images.
**Progressive Web App (PWA):** Enjoy offline play and a native-like experience on your device's home screen. (Supported on most modern Android devices and some newer iPhones/iPads.)
